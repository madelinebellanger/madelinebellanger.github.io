Hello! I'm Madeline, currently a Ph.D. student in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at UNC Charlotte. I grew up in a small farming town in the (almost) center of North Carolina called Norman. It has a population of ~100 and 0 stoplights. Coming to a large city like Charlotte was very daunting, but I quickly found my footing.

I got my bachelor's degrees in Computer Science with a concentration in Bioinformatics and Anthropology with a focus in Biological Anthropology in 2021. I was apart of UNC Charlotte's Early Entry Master's program, which allowed me to work on my master's during my undergraduate career. I finished my master's in Bioinformatics in 2022. I am now in my second year of my Ph.D., with the hopes of advancing to candidacy soon.

In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my cats, Toodie and Biscuit, and my fiance, Scott. I am a registered yoga teacher (RYT200) and enjoy yoga (obviously), pilates, hiking, and just about anything a craft store has to offer. I'm a Wordle master (my longest streak was 274 days), but really bad at the NYT crossword. I'm also restoring a 1984 Chevrolet Suburban in my (very limited) free time.
